NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument
       given to man is normally the name of a program, utility
       or  function.   The manual page associated with each of
       these arguments is then found and  displayed.   A  sec‐
       tion, if provided, will direct man to look only in that
       section of the manual.  The default action is to search
       in  all  of  the available sections following a pre-de‐
       fined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the  first
       page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual
       followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
 Manual page man(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)
